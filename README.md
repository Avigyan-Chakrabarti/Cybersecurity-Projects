# Cybersecurity-Projects
This repository is about two cybersecurity projects: -

1) Password strength Indicator - This program accepts a password made up of random characters and checks the strength of password, with a strength indicator and mandatory warnings.
2) Cesar Cipher - This program encrypts a message using ‘Caesar Cipher’ technique, i.e., by shifting letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. To decrypt the message, the receiver reverses the shift.
