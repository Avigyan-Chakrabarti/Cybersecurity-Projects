# Cybersecurity-Projects
This repository is about two cybersecurity projects: -

1) Password strength Indicator - This program accepts a password made up of random characters and checks the strength of password, with a strength indicator and mandatory warnings.
2) Cesar Cipher - This program encrypts a message using ‘Caesar Cipher’ technique, i.e., by shifting letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted. To decrypt the message, the receiver reverses the shift.

# Streamlit
Streamlit module is used to create the two projects. It is an open-source Python library that allows you to create web applications for data science and machine learning with minimal effort. It is designed to be easy to use, enabling users to quickly turn data scripts into shareable web applications. Some common use cases for Streamlit include:

Data Exploration and Visualization: You can use Streamlit to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for exploring datasets. It's an excellent tool for data scientists and analysts to quickly prototype and share insights.

Machine Learning Prototyping: Streamlit is widely used for building prototypes and demos of machine learning models. You can integrate interactive components to showcase model predictions, input parameters, and results.

Interactive Reports: Streamlit is suitable for creating interactive reports and presentations. You can embed visualizations, charts, and explanations to make your reports more engaging and user-friendly.

Custom Web Apps: You can build custom web applications for various purposes, such as data entry forms, calculators, and decision support systems. Streamlit simplifies the process of creating web interfaces without requiring extensive knowledge of web development.

Education and Training: Streamlit is a great tool for creating interactive educational materials. You can build applications that demonstrate concepts, run simulations, or provide hands-on exercises for learning purposes.

Prototyping APIs: If you're developing an API, you can use Streamlit to quickly create a user interface to interact with your API. This allows you to test and showcase your API functionality easily.

Real-Time Data Monitoring: Streamlit can be used to build real-time data monitoring dashboards. You can connect your Streamlit app to live data sources and update the visualizations dynamically.

Collaboration: Streamlit apps are easy to share, making collaboration simpler. You can deploy your app on various platforms, such as Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or other cloud services.

# Streamlit App content
Here's a simple example of a Streamlit script:

import streamlit as st

st.title("My Streamlit App")
user_input = st.text_input("Enter something:")
st.write(f"You entered: {user_input}")

Run the app using: streamlit run {{program_name}}.py
You can save this script as a .py file and run it using the streamlit run command. The Streamlit app will automatically launch in your default web browser, providing a simple input field where users can type something.

Streamlit's strength lies in its simplicity and ability to turn Python scripts into interactive web applications with minimal code.
